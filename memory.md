# EventSphere Management — Project Memory

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for _context that must survive between work sessions_ (human or AI). Read this file **first** at the start of every session; update it **last** at the end of every session.
> **Related docs:** [prd.md](./prd.md) · [architecture.md](./architecture.md) · [design.md](./design.md) · [rules.md](./rules.md) · [tasks.md](./tasks.md)

## 0. How to Use This File

1. **Start of session:** read §1 (snapshot), §2 (status), §8 (open questions), and the latest entry in §10 (session log).
2. **During work:** if you make a decision that others must know, add it to §5 (decision log) immediately.
3. **End of session:** update §2 (status), tick items in `tasks.md`, append an entry to §10, and move resolved questions out of §8.
4. **Never store secrets** (API keys, passwords, connection strings) here.
5. If this file conflicts with `prd.md` / `architecture.md`, **the PRD and architecture win** — fix this file.

| **Origin**                            | Aptech **eProject** (React + Node.js + MongoDB; Express deliberately omitted — D-013). Deliverables: working app, source code, full documentation, demo video, sent to the eProjects Team                            |
| **Client (fictional)**                | EventSphere Management — large-scale expo organiser                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Solution**                          | Web app with 3 roles (admin/organizer, exhibitor, attendee): auth, expo + floor plan + booth management, exhibitor applications, schedules, search, messaging, notifications, analytics, feedback, real-time updates |
| **Stack**                             | MongoDB · **plain Node.js 20 `http` (no Express)** · React 18 (Vite) · **Bootstrap 5.3 + React-Bootstrap** · Socket.IO · TanStack Query · Zod · JWT                                                                  |
| **Repo layout**                       | Monorepo: `/client`, `/server`, `/docs`                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Source brief**                      | `MERN-EventSphere_Management.docx` (Introduction, Objectives, Background, FRs, NFRs, HW/SW)                                                                                                                          |
| **Hardware/Software note from brief** | Windows OS + MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js + any editor. (Project owner chose to omit Express — D-013.) (Brief lists very old hardware specs — ignore; target modern dev machines.)                                  |

## 4. Core Facts & Invariants (do not violate)

1. Roles are exactly `admin`, `exhibitor`, `attendee`. **Admins are never created via public registration.**
2. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost ≥ 12); `passwordHash` is never returned by any API.
3. Access token lives **in memory** on the client; refresh token is an **httpOnly cookie**.
4. An exhibitor can reserve a booth **only after** their application for that expo is `approved`.
5. Booth reservation must be **atomic** — no double booking. Conflicts return `409`.
6. Sessions in the same room must **not overlap in time**.
7. All API responses use the envelope `{ success, data, meta? }` or `{ success:false, error:{code,message,details?} }`.
8. All inputs are validated with **Zod** at the route boundary.
9. Real-time events **invalidate** client queries; clients don't hand-edit server data.
10. Privacy: consent is stored with timestamp; users can export and delete their data.
11. Every list endpoint is paginated (default 20, max 100).
12. No secrets in the repo; `.env.example` is maintained.
13. **No Express** (or Express-style frameworks). HTTP is native `node:http` + `server/src/core`. **Bootstrap is the only CSS framework.**

## 6. Conventions Cheat-Sheet

_(Full details in `rules.md`.)_

- **Branches:** `main` (protected) ← `feat/<scope>-<short>` · `fix/…` · `chore/…`
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits — `feat(booths): atomic reserve endpoint`
- **Files:** server `kebab-case.js` with suffix (`expo.service.js`); client components `PascalCase.jsx`, hooks `useThing.js`
- **API paths:** plural nouns, kebab-case, `/api/v1/...`
- **DB:** collections plural lowercase; fields camelCase; always define indexes in the model
- **Env:** only via `config/env.js` (validated with Zod) — never `process.env` directly elsewhere
- **Tests:** colocate `*.test.js`; every service function has a unit test; every route has an integration test per role (allowed + denied)
- **Definition of Done:** see `rules.md` §14

## 9. Known Risks & Watch-Outs

- **Double booking** under concurrency → covered by atomic update + test (see `architecture.md` §6.3).
- **Replica set requirement** for transactions in local Mongo → provide docker-compose with `--replSet`.
- **Hand-rolled HTTP core** can sprawl or hide security bugs → keep `core/` small (~400 lines), unit-test each module, security-review it (T-9.3); never re-implement framework features we don't need.
- **Bootstrap JS vs React** → use React-Bootstrap only; no `data-bs-*` imperative behaviour.
- **Floor-plan editor** can balloon in scope → MVP = rectangles + grid snap only.
- **Socket auth expiry** → on token refresh, reconnect socket with the new token.
- **Timezones** → store UTC; display in expo venue timezone; label it.
- **Deliverables outside code** (user docs, developer docs, **demo video**) are mandatory in the brief — don't leave to the end (see `tasks.md` Phase 9).

## 10. Session Log (append newest at the bottom)

### Session 0 — Planning

- **Input:** `MERN-EventSphere_Management.docx` analysed.
- **Output:** Created `architecture.md`, `design.md`, `memory.md`, `prd.md`, `rules.md`, `tasks.md` (baseline v1.0).
- **Decisions:** D-001 → D-012 recorded above.
- **Assumptions:** Q-01 → Q-08 recorded in §8.
- **Next:** Phase 0 scaffolding.

### Session 2 — Nov 8 2026 — Phase 0 + T-1.10 scaffold and test verification
- **Goal:** Complete repo scaffolding, client/server setup, in-house native HTTP core, and verify test harness.
- **Done:** T-0.1 to T-0.9 (monorepo, Vite React Bootstrap client, plain Node.js server, Zod env validation, docker-compose), T-1.10 (native HTTP core), T-1.1 (Mongo connection with retry, graceful shutdown, and `/health`), T-1.2 (ApiError hierarchy, response helpers success/error envelopes, pagination helper), and T-1.3 (Zod validation middleware, errorHandler, notFound, request-ID correlation, and pino log redaction).
- **Testing:** 13 test suites, 90/90 tests passing green.
- **Git:** Staged, committed with conventional commits, and pushed directly to `origin/main` (`MuhammadSiddiq-Tech/Event-Sphere-Management-Project`).
- **Next:** Phase 1 foundation: T-1.4 (security middleware & rate-limit testing), T-1.5–T-1.9.
- **Goal:** Apply owner's stack choice: React + Bootstrap, plain Node.js without Express; rest unchanged.
- **Done:** Updated all six docs (architecture §4/§5.3/§11/ADRs, design §5/§6.1/§11, rules §3/§4/§5, tasks Phase 0–1, prd header, this file).
- **Decisions:** D-013, D-014, D-015; D-008 revised.
- **Open:** Q-09 (is Node-only backend acceptable for the brief's "MERN"?).
- **Next:** Phase 0 scaffolding, then T-1.10 (HTTP core) before other Phase 1 tasks.

<!-- TEMPLATE
### Session N — <date> — <short title>
- **Goal:**
- **Done:** (link task IDs, e.g. T-2.3, T-2.4)
- **Decisions:** (new D-IDs)
